# trailRunnin

A simple game where a "runner" must jump over oncoming rocks.

## Stack

- p5.js

## About

The inspiration for this app came from the internet-outage dinosaur chrome game. It was a lot of fun to think through the various features that would make this game actually playable. Very quickly one realizes that even basic games like the dinosaur chrome game require a suprising amount of functionality needed in order to make the game fair, repeatable, and challenging. 

## Challenges

- Incorporating css elements into p5.js
- Adjusting the timing of the rocks and the jump height to be difficult but playable
- Understanding the timing of the p5.js loop function
- Making it playable on mobile

## Future Features

- Move the legs of the runner or swap the image after a collision
- Add additional obstacles and vary the terrain
- Store the high scores on a server
